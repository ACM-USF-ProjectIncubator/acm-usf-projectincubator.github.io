# Introduction
This repository provides a guide on how to get started with GitHub Pages to showcase your achievements to the world! This tutorial does not use Jekyll because it requires the additional downloading of Ruby, and is not currently supported for Windows.

Things we'll be covering:
1. How to set up GitHub Pages
2. Setting up a basic website (Using templates! No need to reinvent the wheel... Unless you want to:tada:)
3. What is a static website?
    - Are there other kinds of websites? 
    - Are there limitations?

Feel free to clone this repository and customise your website to your heart's desire!

# Layout of Repository
```
.
├── index.html          # Website landing page
├── style.css           # Layout of website
├── assets/             # Images and audio used for website
└── README.md
```
Two things to note here:
1. We'll be configuring our GitHub Pages site to be built from the root of our master branch
2. While it's not necessary to name the folder of your assets as ```assets/```, it is convention!
