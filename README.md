# Introduction
This repository provides a guide on how to get started with GitHub Pages to showcase your achievements to the world! This tutorial does not use Jekyll because it requires the additional downloading of Ruby, and is not currently supported for Windows. I'll also be using VSCode for the demonstration. There's a VSCode extension called "Live Server" that allows you to view your changes to the website just by saving, making it super convenient for debugging.

Things we'll be covering:
1. How to set up GitHub Pages
2. Setting up a basic website (Using templates! No need to reinvent the wheel... Unless you want to)
3. Understanding what we've yoinked off the internet (respectfully, crediting the creators)
    - How do we edit the code to fit our needs?
4. What is a static website?
    - Are there other kinds of websites? 
    - Are there limitations?

Feel free to clone this repository and customise your website to your heart's desire!

Things to note:
1. We'll be configuring our GitHub Pages site to be built from the root of our master branch
2. While it's not necessary to name the folder of your assets as ```assets/```, it is convention!
